<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've had an interest in technology for as long as I can remember. The first time I saw some code 
  I felt intrigued to learn more about it, and after trying some simple HTML stuff I decided it would make for a fun career. 
  As such, I'm now learning web development.</p>

<p>A few other fields of the tech industry I find interesting are software development, cybersecurity, A.I, and robotics. 
  Developing a game is also something I've thought about a lot and I'd like to try it someday. I think using code and digital art 
  together to make something could be pretty interesting, and the end product would be rewarding to see.</p>
